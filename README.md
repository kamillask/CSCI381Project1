# Modernized eMovies Diagram

This repo contains the erwin file for the modernized eMovies diagram. It includes a conceptual, logical, and physical diagram.


## Roadmap
1. Laid out all of the entities for the Conceptual model, and determined the relationships between them.
2. Added definitions to the entities.
3. Created the Logical diagram, and chose the auto-populate option to bring in all of the entities.
4. Added all of the needed attributes to the entities.
5. Added definitions to the relationships between entities.
6. Created the Physical model, which was once again populated by the auto-populate feature.
7. Added data values and domains for all of the attributes.
8. Added physical definitions to the relationships.


## Solution
The user is created, at first without any subscription. When the subscription is created, a payment is made to the company. The company has employees that are set to unique departments. When a user consumes a piece of media, it is added to their UserHistory. This stores data on what they have or have not watched, and also the progress of media that they may have not yet finished. The user is also able to take out rentals on movies without a subscription. The subscription has different tiers with different featues, and a different payment is made dependent on their subsciption tier.
